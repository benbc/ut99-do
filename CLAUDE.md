* Fail fast instead of trying to provide failovers
* Don't use TDD for this project
* No Co-Authored-By or other AI attribution in commits
* Don't ask what execution option to ues: pick subagent-driven
* Look for opportunities to remove duplication
* Always prefer starting from a blank slate rather than patching things
* Prefer single-line and pipe-less shell commands where possible, to make it easier for the user to give blanket approval for some operations (e.g. git commit)
* Run bash commands (e.g. git) individually rather than and-ing them together, to make approval easier
