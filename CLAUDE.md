* Fail fast instead of trying to provide failovers
* Don't use TDD for this project
* No Co-Authored-By or other AI attribution in commits
* Use subagent-driven development for implementation
* Look for opportunities to remove duplication
* Always prefer starting from a blank slate rather than patching things
